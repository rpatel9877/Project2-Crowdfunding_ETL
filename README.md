# Project2-ETL

Crowdfunding_ETL project July 31, 2023

Contributors: Rajan Patel, Ralf Welvers
For this project we built an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. After we transformed the data, we created four CSV files and used the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, we uploaded the CSV file data into a PostgreSQL database.

The code can be found in the following file:

The database ERD diagram can be found here:

The database DDL can be found here:

The original data sources and the code generated csv files can be found in the following folder:
